# Connected cuckoo clock


## Rationale

The goal of this project is to maintain my development skills and capabilities in embedded projects, 
and to implement technologies I don't master yet but I think are worth to learn in current technology context.

These technologies are:

* EInk displays
* Field Oriented Control for brushless motor
* I2S

I have chosen to use ESP-IDF as it is a more professional oriented development plateform than Arduino, 
and it offers more flexibility in the design choices.

I also want to use a "standard" quality process for software development to prove the effectiveness of the development.

- Define functional specifications
- Develop/implement the required functionalities
- Verify the functionalities ( will be done using Unity, integrated to ISP-IDF )
